## 🎯 Project Overview

This project analyzes large customer datasets to identify behavioral patterns driving churn, predict at-risk customers before they leave, and support data-driven retention strategies. The result: a **12% improvement in retention** after implementing model-driven interventions.

---

## ✨ Dashboard Features

### 📊 Overview Tab
- Real-time KPI cards — total customers, churn rate, at-risk accounts, revenue at risk
- Retention rate trend: actual vs model-predicted
- Churn breakdown by customer segment (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB, Freemium)
- Engagement vs Tenure scatter plot with churn probability heatmap

### 🚨 At-Risk Tab
- Live queue of high-churn-probability customers sorted by risk score
- Days inactive, ARR, and risk level per account
- AI-recommended actions (e.g., immediate call, discount offer, feature demo)

### 🤖 Model Tab
- Logistic Regression performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Feature importance breakdown — top predictors of churn
- Confusion matrix with TP, FP, FN, TN breakdown
- Model comparison vs Random Forest and SVM

### 📅 Cohorts Tab
- Monthly cohort retention heatmap
- Multi-line retention curves by acquisition cohort
- Drop-off pattern analysis across customer lifecycle

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

### Model: Logistic Regression

| Metric | Score |
|---|---|
| Accuracy | **85%** |
| Precision | 82% |
| Recall | 79% |
| F1 Score | 0.804 |

### Top Churn Predictors
1. **Days Since Last Login** (31%) — strongest signal
2. **Support Ticket Volume** (24%) — friction indicator
3. **Feature Adoption Rate** (19%) — product stickiness
4. **Contract Age** (13%) — lifecycle stage
5. **NPS Score** (8%) — satisfaction signal
6. **Payment Delays** (5%) — financial health

### Why Logistic Regression?
Outperformed Random Forest (81%) and SVM (79%) on the validation set, with the added benefit of interpretable coefficients for business stakeholders.

## 🔧 Connecting Real Data

Replace sample data with your actual data source:

```javascript
// Example: Fetch from your backend API
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('/api/churn-metrics')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      setKpiData(data.kpis);
      setAtRiskCustomers(data.atRisk);
    });
}, []);
```

### SQL Query Example
```sql
SELECT
  customer_id,
  days_since_login,
  support_tickets,
  feature_adoption_rate,
  nps_score,
  churn_label
FROM customer_features
WHERE snapshot_date = CURRENT_DATE;
```
